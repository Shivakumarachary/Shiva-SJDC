     <p style="color:#1c0219bb">Helena Petrovna Blavatsky[a] (née Hahn von Rottenstern; 12 August [O.S. 31 July] 1831
            – 8
            May 1891), often known
            as Madame Blavatsky, was a Russian and American mystic and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in
            1875. She gained an international following as the leading theoretician of Theosophy.

            Born into an aristocratic family in Yekaterinoslav, then in the Russian Empire (now Dnipro in Ukraine),
            Blavatsky traveled widely around the empire as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in
            Western esotericism during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1849 she embarked on a
            series of
            world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She also claimed that during this period she
            encountered a group of spiritual adepts, the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom", who sent her to Shigatse,
            Tibet,
            where they trained her to develop a deeper understanding of the synthesis of religion, philosophy, and
            science.

        <li style="background-color: azure;width: fit-content;"> Isis Unvieled</li>
        <p>The book "Isis Unveiled" by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky is a significant work of esoteric philosophy and a
            critical response to materialism in science and religion. It was first published in 1877 and explores
            ancient and modern science and theology. Blavatsky's combination of original insights and scholarly
            sources in the book has been praised by modern occultism for defying materialist science

            2
            . However, the book has faced criticism for extensive plagiarism, with some scholars accusing it of
            borrowing extensively from other sources without proper acknowledgment
            3
            4
            . Despite the mixed reception, "Isis Unveiled" remains a notable work in the realm of esoteric
            philosophy and theosophy.
