    <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
    <p>Helena Petrovna Blavatsky[a] (née Hahn von Rottenstern; 12 August [O.S. 31 July] 1831 – 8 May 1891), often known
        as Madame Blavatsky, was a Russian and American mystic and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in
        1875. She gained an international following as the leading theoretician of Theosophy.

        Born into an aristocratic family in Yekaterinoslav, then in the Russian Empire (now Dnipro in Ukraine),
        Blavatsky traveled widely around the empire as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in
        Western esotericism during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1849 she embarked on a series of
        world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She also claimed that during this period she
        encountered a group of spiritual adepts, the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom", who sent her to Shigatse, Tibet,
        where they trained her to develop a deeper understanding of the synthesis of religion, philosophy, and science.
